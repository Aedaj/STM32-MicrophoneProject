##  Overview

This system uses **MEMS microphone data acquisition**, **analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)**, and **real-time audio processing** to demonstrate embedded audio signal processing on the STM32 platform. Key capabilities include:

- High-pass filtering to remove low-frequency noise
- Real-time robot voice effect using delayed signal modification
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis for frequency spectrum visualization
- SD card audio storage in `.wav` format (both raw and processed audio)
- LCD display for dominant frequency and system status
